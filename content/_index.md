## Welcome to the Kubernets(K8s) 101 Workshop
ACME is embarking on deploying a hyperscale web application.

### Concerns:
- Decoupling Applications from Infrastructure
- Automatic Scaling
- Seamless Upgrades
- High Availability (HA)
- Security
- Cost Management
- Performance Monitoring and Logging
- Disaster Recovery and Data Persistence
- Compliance and Data Sovereignty
- Service Mesh Integration
- Developer Productivity
- Interoperability and Integration

### Considered Alternatives:
- Docker Compose
- Docker Swarm
- Apache Mesos
- Nomad

### Kubernetes Achievements:

- **Decoupling**: Application from Infrastructure
- **Scaling**: Automatic and Efficient
- **Upgrades**: Seamless with Zero Downtime
- **HA**: Robust Support for High Availability
- **Security**: Enhanced with RBAC, Network Policies, PSP
- **Resource Utilization**: Optimized and Efficient
- **Monitoring**: Integration with Tools like Prometheus
- **Data Persistence**: Support for StatefulSets and Persistent Volumes
- **Flexibility**: Across Various Environments
- **Service Mesh**: Easy Integration with Istio/Envoy
- **Developer Productivity**: Automation of Deployment and Management
- **Integration**: With CI/CD, Databases, Monitoring Tools, etc.

Non-Kubernetes solutions face challenges with scalability, automation, complexity in management, cost-effectiveness at scale, and lack of ecosystem support.

**This workshop focuses on deploying, scaling, and upgrading applications with Kubernetes**, addressing these challenges by leveraging Kubernetes' comprehensive and extensible platform, designed for efficient container orchestration.
